# BeerFridgeController
The Beer Fridge Controller project was developed for Brewers to control the fermentation temperature of beer. A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ was used to host a server and website. The server was implemented with Python to request the temperature from a temperature sensor (DS18B20) , to open/close the fridge with a Power Relay Module and with the use of Flask web Framework to host the website in order the user to monitor the Beer Fridge.
